## Final Project

_Proposal:_

We hope to obtain data via DOI and analyze a research paper about biodiversity loss for multiple species over a certain length of time.

- We would like to replicate results of the existing study that was done in the research paper.  
- We aim to create our own graph to compare trends between different species.  
- Analyze how biodiversity is measured. What are possible causes of biodiversity loss and how do they relate to the trends in the graphs we created? What are the future effects of the loss of species diversity?

## Background

The graph below is from an article written by Ripple and colleagues titled "Are we eating the world's megafauna to extinction?". Megafauna extinction risk and trends are shown in percentages of species classified as threatened by the IUCN Red List Category Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered and with decreasing population trend. Ripple and colleagues obtained their data from the Amniote database for mammals, reptiles, and birds (Myhrvold et al., 2015). The complete data sets from Myhrvold et al. are located in the Ecological Archives at http://esapubs.org/archive with accession number E096-269.

We hope to replicate these results for mammals, birds, and reptiles, as well as perform our own further analyses with the data.

## Explanation of Replicated and Original Results

Ripple and colleagues considered megafauna as mammalian species with a body mass of over 100 kg, and bird or reptile species with a body mass of over 40 kg. Our replicated plot is almost identical to the plot from the original article. However, we have a more updated version of the data from IUCN in comparison to the data from the study, hence any slight deviations in our data from the study data. We calculated the percentages of megafauna and all vertebrates that were categorized as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered by the IUCN red list and grouped the species by class for the following classes: ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii), cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes), birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Other minor fish classes contained no species with masses â‰¥100 kg and thus were only included in the results for all vertebrates together. We determined the percentages of species threatened and decreasing for species classified as megafauna and for all vertebrates with available data. We can see in the replicated graph that megafauna species are more threatened and have a relatively higher percentage of decreasing populations than all vertebrates together, especially in reptiles and mammals.

For our original graph, we extracted the population trends from the species narratives of the IUCN red list api and combined them with our threatened megafauna data. We then sorted the data by class and population trend, and counted the number of species for each trend. Some of the species had unknown or non-applicable population trends, but we can see clearly that a majority of threatened megafauna mammals have a decreasing population. The only threatened megafauna Aves species also fell into the decreasing population category compared to the other trends, and there were more threatened megafauna reptiles that are decreasing in population than increasing or stable.
  
## Analysis of Biodiversity Loss: Analyze how biodiversity is measured. What are possible causes of biodiversity loss and how do they relate to the trends in the graphs we created? What are the future effects of the loss of species diversity?

Ripple and colleagues suggest that threats to large species may be due to a combination of hunting and habitat degradation; excessive hunting occurs for the acquisition of meat or for body parts such as skins, horns, organs, and antlers for traditional medicine or trophies. To assess this, we used species lists from IUCN to estimate biodiversity loss. As shown in our data, megafauna populations are more likely to be threatened compared to their smaller counterparts. Most megafauna tend to be K-selected species and are extremely vulnerable to fishing, trapping, and hunting pressures (Johnson, 2002). The megafauna are especially targeted given their size, as hunting these larger animals will produce more profit when being sold, as compared to non-megafauna, smaller animals. Decreasing population trends, especially in mammals, are due to slower reproduction rates that are unable to compete with the rate of hunting and habitat loss. In addition to intentional harvesting, many megafauna species are possibly simultaneously affected by various types of habitat degradation from anthropogenic activities, such as agriculture and deforestation. When taken together, these threats can have major negative cumulative effects on vertebrate species (Betts et al., 2017; Shackelford, Standish, Ripple, & Starzomski, 2018). Consistent with our results, overexploitation and habitat loss are considered major twin threats to biodiversity in general (Maxwell et al., 2016). Biodiversity loss negatively affects the ability of ecosystems to function properly and therefore undermines their ability to support a healthy environment. Consequently, it can directly affect human health as well if ecosystem services are unable to meet social needs (Roe, 2019).
